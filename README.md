High Energy Diffraction at the LHC via Combinatorial (incidence) Algebra

Novel constructions and algorithms:

- Unfolded multidimensional 'fiducial vector cross sections'
- Multivariate Maximum Likelihood fit extraction of the effective Pomeron intercept 1 + Delta
- Multivariate Maximum Likelihood fit extraction of the diffractive cross sections (SD, DD, ND) and the maximum diffractive mass dependence (minimum average rapidity gap size)
- MÃ¶bius inversion of pileup
- Multidimensional algebraic hierarchy of detector level distributions (raw multiplicity etc.) - highly constraining comparison with MC models

For reference, you may cite the paper above.
